# FastAPI Project - Deployment

You can deploy the project using Docker Compose to a remote server.

This project expects you to have a Traefik proxy handling communication to the outside world and HTTPS certificates.

You can use CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) systems to deploy automatically, there are already configurations to do it with GitHub Actions.

But you have to configure a couple things first. 🤓

## Deploy the FastAPI Project

Now that you have Traefik in place you can deploy your FastAPI project with Docker Compose.

**Note**: You might want to jump ahead to the section about Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions.

## Environment Variables

You need to set some environment variables first.

Set the `ENVIRONMENT`, by default `local` (for development), but when deploying to a server you would put something like `staging` or `production`:

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=production
```

Set the `DOMAIN`, by default `localhost` (for development), but when deploying you would use your own domain, for example:

```bash
export DOMAIN=fastapi-project.example.com
```

You can set several variables, like:

* `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of the project, used in the API for the docs and emails.
* `STACK_NAME`: The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name, this should be different for `staging`, `production`, etc. You could use the same domain replacing dots with dashes, e.g. `fastapi-project-example-com` and `staging-fastapi-project-example-com`.
* `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`: A list of allowed CORS origins separated by commas.
* `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for the FastAPI project, used to sign tokens.
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER`: The email of the first superuser, this superuser will be the one that can create new users.
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: The password of the first superuser.
* `EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL`: The email account to send emails from.
* `POSTGRES_SERVER`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL server. You can leave the default of `db`, provided by the same Docker Compose. You normally wouldn't need to change this unless you are using a third-party provider.
* `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port of the PostgreSQL server. You can leave the default. You normally wouldn't need to change this unless you are using a third-party provider.
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The Postgres password.
* `POSTGRES_USER`: The Postgres user, you can leave the default.
* `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name to use for this application. You can leave the default of `app`.

## GitHub Actions Environment Variables

There are some environment variables only used by GitHub Actions that you can configure:

* `LATEST_CHANGES`: Used by the GitHub Action [latest-changes](https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes) to automatically add release notes based on the PRs merged. It's a personal access token, read the docs for details.
* `SMOKESHOW_AUTH_KEY`: Used to handle and publish the code coverage using [Smokeshow](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/smokeshow), follow their instructions to create a (free) Smokeshow key.

### Generate secret keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.


## Continuous Deployment (CD)

You can use GitHub Actions to deploy your project automatically. 😎

You can have multiple environment deployments.

There are already two environments configured, `staging` and `production`. 🚀

### Set Secrets

On your repository, configure secrets for the environment variables you need, the same ones described above, including `SECRET_KEY`, etc. Follow the [official GitHub guide for setting repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

The current Github Actions workflows expect these secrets:

* `DOMAIN_PRODUCTION`
* `DOMAIN_STAGING`
* `STACK_NAME_PRODUCTION`
* `STACK_NAME_STAGING`
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER`
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
* `SECRET_KEY`
* `LATEST_CHANGES`
* `SMOKESHOW_AUTH_KEY`

## GitHub Action Deployment Workflows

There are GitHub Action workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory already configured for deploying to the environments (GitHub Actions runners with the labels):

* `staging`: after pushing (or merging) to the branch `master`.
* `production`: after publishing a release.

If you need to add extra environments you could use those as a starting point.
